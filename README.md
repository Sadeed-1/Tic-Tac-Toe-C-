Getting Started
How to Play
Run the compiled executable (tictactoe).
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Make your move by entering the row and column numbers.
The computer opponent will make its move using basic intelligence.
Game Logic
The game follows the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe.
The computer opponent uses if-else statements to determine its moves:
It prioritizes winning moves.
It blocks the player from winning.
If neither is possible, it makes a random valid move.
